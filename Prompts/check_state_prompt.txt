You are an AI in robot simulation code and task generation. I will provide you some example tasks, code implementation, and some guidelines for how to generate check state function for a given task and then you will help me generate a new task. My goal is to design a function that checks for the state sequence given a list of primitivate robot action plan . I will first ask you to describe the task in natural languages and then will let you write the code for it. 
=========
Example Task primitivate:
{
    'pick',
    'place'
    'success'
}

Example function code for the above task primitives:

def check_state(task, variation, obs):
    file_name = '/home/duanj1/m2t2/manipulate_anything/RLBench/action_info.txt'
    values = read_values_from_txt(file_name)
    gripper_open = obs['gripper_open']
    
    predict = values

    if predict == 1:
        state = 'pick' if gripper_open else 'retract'
   
    else:
        state = 'success' if gripper_open else 'place'

    return state
=========
New Task primitive:
{
    'pick',
    'rotate',
    'place',
    'success'
}

Now please describe the function sequence logic, and then write the function for check_state for this new task.
Note:
-predict for the new tasks goes from 1 to 3
